    <p>
        Coffee Momets, a part of Coffee Day Global Limited, 
        is India’s favourite hangout for coffee and conversations.
        Popularly known as CM, we strive to provide the best 
        experience to our guests. Our coffees are sourced from 
        thousands of small coffee planters, who made us who we 
        are today and we're glad to be a part of their lives.
        We opened our first cafe in 1990 at Brigade Road in 
        Bangalore – the youth and the young at heart immediately 
        took to the cafe, and it continues to be one of the most 
        happening places in the city.
        It's been an exciting journey since then to becoming 
        the largest organised retail cafe chain in the country. 
        We’re also present in Austria, USA and 
        Malaysia, so if your travel takes you there, do 
        stop by our outlets to get a taste from back home!
